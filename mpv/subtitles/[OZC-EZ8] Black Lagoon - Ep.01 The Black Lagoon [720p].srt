1
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:18,340
I have a big gun, I took it from my Lord...

2
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:21,790
Sick with Justice, I just wanna feel you...

3
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:25,200
I'm your angel, only a ring away...

4
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,550
You make me violate you, no matter who you are!

5
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:38,670
It's all up to you, no one lives forever...

6
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:42,260
Been burn in the hell, by all those pigs out there...

7
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:45,530
It's always been hell, from when I was born...

8
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:48,720
They make me violate them, no matter who they are!

9
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:52,260
Get down on your knees! Get a good head on your shoulders!

10
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,690
If it's for your guys, go to the end of the Earth...

11
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:59,000
Do what you think, give it with dedication...

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,270
I'll put out your misery!

13
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,670
You made a mess! For Christ sakes, this rotten world!

14
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:09,100
Shit out of luck! Go with my vision!

15
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:12,540
Light up the fire! Right on the power!

16
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,900
Weapon... I have it all!

17
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:24,480
Weapon... I have it all!

18
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:38,260
Somehow graduating from
state university, I made my way...

19
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:40,790
...into a businessman's city.

20
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,090
I get kicked around by my superior.

21
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:51,660
But I yearn to be like that someday,
in order to remain sane in this place.

22
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,310
This is the city of winter, where I lived.

23
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,770
However, all that seems so far away.

24
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:06,450
All I see before me is the azure of
the China Sea, stirring winds, and...

25
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,920
Okay, Mr. Japanese, I'll ask you again.

26
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:17,490
The package you got from Asahi
Industries headquarters in Tokyo.

27
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:20,730
The one you're in charge of until you
hand it over to the chief in Borneo.

28
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,170
This is it, right?

29
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,960
Yeah. But what I wanna know is...

30
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:29,240
That's all. That's everything
we needed to ask you.

31
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:32,550
Dutch, this is a pain in the ass.

32
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:35,670
Shoot him in the knees. Then
he'll start singing like a bird.

33
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:39,580
There's no need. That one disk is
more than enough for the compensation.

34
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,940
Compensation, you say.

35
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,020
Dutch. Hey, Dutch.
Are you through yet?

36
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:48,390
There's someone heading
straight for us from Subic Bay.

37
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:49,260
It's probably...

38
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,130
...a patrol boat
from the Filipino Navy.

39
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,560
Don't panic, Benny-boy. Everything's
taken care of. Start the engines.

40
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:00,700
Okay, gentlemen!

41
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:04,440
We're gonna disperse and
then you'll be free to go.

42
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:09,480
But the deal's off if anyone
decides to come after us.

43
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:12,580
What you see there is
a torpedo launcher.

44
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:15,520
If you don't wanna be blown
out of the water...

45
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,650
...then stay still for the next half hour.

46
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:20,390
After that, you're free to do as you wish.

47
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,730
We're saved.

48
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:24,920
What are you getting so relaxed over?

49
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,960
You're coming with us. You damn fool.

50
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,870
You're joking. You're joking, right?

51
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:32,700
Shut up and walk.

52
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:39,740
You're joking, right?!

53
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,780
Japan is drifting farther away.

54
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,750
Black Lagoon to Balalaika.
Can you hear me?

55
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:51,380
Just fine, Dutch. What about the catch?

56
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:52,150
I've got it, of course.

57
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:54,760
I love jobs that get done properly, Dutch.

58
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:56,930
The trade-off goes as planned.

59
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,590
Yes, as promised.

60
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:05,700
Connect me to Tokyo.

61
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:10,470
How about an explanation, Investigation
Division Manager Kageyama?

62
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:14,210
Regarding the case we
have been informed about.

63
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:16,820
Let me explain the situation
to you further.

64
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:22,280
Today at 4 pm, the Bougainvillea
Trade Company contacted us...

65
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:28,490
...regarding negotiations for the
disk stolen from the Melanesia.

66
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,830
What is this company?

67
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:33,300
They're the Russian Mafia.

68
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:37,300
The front for the group
that aims to take...

69
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:41,940
...top position after displacing the
Chinese Mafia from Southeast Asia.

70
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,310
What are they specifically after? Money?

71
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:49,680
Most likely the route to Southeast Asia
where the barter is going to take place.

72
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:55,880
They wish to take part in some of
our more unsavory trade routes.

73
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:57,680
Blackmail.

74
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,230
It's shameful, having something
to be blackmailed about.

75
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:06,020
But they do not seem to know
what's really on the disk.

76
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:09,730
If they ever find out, it will lead to...

77
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,500
...the worst scandal
in Asahi Industries' history.

78
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,900
Indeed.

79
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:20,380
We just received a report from Jakarta.

80
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,880
According to a local Chinese merchant...

81
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:26,940
...the Russian Mafia has
yet to receive the disk.

82
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:32,010
The disk is still in the hands of the
pirates that attacked the Melanesia.

83
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:37,730
This is our chance. We cannot
trust the word of the Mafia.

84
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:42,100
We must get the disk
before it reaches them.

85
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,000
Before it reaches them? But how?

86
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:52,770
I understand. The board will leave
this matter in your hands, Kageyama.

87
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:55,700
Choosing what action to take
will also be your responsibility.

88
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:02,550
Revy, what do you plan on
doing with this hostage? Well?

89
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:06,120
You don't get it. You
just don't get it, Dutch.

90
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:10,490
Think about it! We get twenty grand
for this job! Only twenty grand!

91
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,590
What's wrong with collecting a
bonus by asking for a ransom?

92
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:15,970
You're being simpleminded.

93
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:17,930
You wanna get killed, Benny?!

94
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:18,470
Not really.

95
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:21,700
So, who's gonna negotiate
with them? You?

96
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:24,140
Do you have their phone number?

97
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:26,440
What about a bank account
to receive the ransom?

98
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:28,470
Fine then!

99
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,950
We'll just kill his ass
and throw him overboard!

100
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:32,640
Stop it!

101
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,680
You idiot! Stop damaging the ship!

102
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,050
Shut up!

103
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:42,620
Dutch. Dutch, I get it.

104
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,030
Get what?

105
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,860
I get your point, so let me go.

106
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:49,030
Okay, Revy. Let's play it cool.

107
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:53,100
I'm alive. I don't know
why, but somehow I'm alive.

108
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:57,240
All right, all right. Let's
go on deck for a smoke.

109
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:03,380
What's gonna happen to me?

110
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:08,350
We'll contact your company
somehow and set up a trade.

111
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,820
A ransom, huh? This'll go
on my permanent record.

112
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:18,560
But we have our own priorities. Getting
the disk to our client comes first.

113
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,290
So there's a client.

114
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:24,500
We're just delivery boys.

115
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:28,340
We brush up against the law
from time to time so we can eat.

116
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:29,310
But that's business.

117
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:34,270
I guess this is what they
call the Stockholm Syndrome.

118
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:38,510
At this moment I feel like
this big guy next to me...

119
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:41,480
...is the only one I can
trust in the whole world.

120
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:44,250
What's your name?

121
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:48,620
Okajima. Rokuro Okajima.

122
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,490
What's the name of that employee?

123
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,160
It's Okajima, Director. Rokuro Okajima.

124
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,970
It is entirely the fault
of my managerial skills.

125
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:00,840
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

126
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:04,870
I was only informed recently, sir.

127
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:06,370
And because there was no
other employee...

128
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:08,470
...we could trust with vital information...

129
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,320
...we lost valuable time in
confirming our sources.

130
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,950
That's enough. Kageyama,
what are your thoughts?

131
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:19,260
Our company is in a crisis.

132
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:22,520
We cannot accept any more delays.

133
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:27,190
The E.O. Company, with whom we've
made a confidential contract...

134
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:29,030
...has already sent their professionals.

135
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,170
Well, it was your responsibility.

136
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:38,040
But I do feel bad for this
employee. What's his name?

137
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:43,040
It's Okajima, Director. Rokuro Okajima.

138
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,220
Let's go, Rock.

139
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:53,560
Rock?

140
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,890
I think he means you.

141
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,160
So let's go.

142
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:00,700
Go where?

143
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:04,000
Some place where we can have
a drink. Don't you wanna come?

144
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:05,940
But I thought I was a hostage.

145
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:07,980
We're leaving.

146
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,500
Wait! I'm coming too!

147
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,100
But where on Earth am I?

148
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:40,370
I just don't get it.

149
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,480
Why is there a pistol on every table?

150
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:47,570
Is this the so-called "bar at the end of
the world" you see in cowboy westerns?

151
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,950
Good analogy.

152
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:52,510
This place was started by Southern
Vietnamese soldiers...

153
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:53,920
...who survived the war.

154
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,750
But they started taking
in fugitive soldiers too...

155
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:59,490
...and before we knew it,
the place went to hell.

156
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:02,490
Hookers, junkies, mercenaries, hitmen...

157
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:06,990
Irredeemable criminals.
Make you uncomfortable?

158
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:11,070
Japanese pubs...

159
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:13,940
I love those unguarded smiles.

160
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,800
Places like this...

161
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,740
Shut up or I'll throw you
out onto the beach. Damn it.

162
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:21,740
I don't like confrontations.

163
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:25,910
Your expression says it all.
Benny, I'm gonna make a call.

164
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:26,880
Sure.

165
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:30,420
He's a bit unusual, the big guy.

166
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:33,480
All I know about him after
being around him for two years...

167
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,030
...is that he's tough,
intelligent and eccentric.

168
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:38,700
Don't even try to understand him.

169
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:43,790
Thanks. You seem different from
the others. Where were you before?

170
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,700
A university in Florida.

171
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:51,440
I was fooling around and pissed
off the Mafia and the FBI. Then...

172
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:56,210
I saved his ass before he was
thrown overboard in a suitcase.

173
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:58,920
Stop the worthless storytelling.

174
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:01,790
You're not old enough to be
reminiscing about the past.

175
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:04,590
One for you, one for me.

176
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:07,660
We came all the way here for a drink.

177
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,960
Let's talk about something a
little more hip, mister Japanese.

178
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:13,360
Why, this is...

179
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,040
Beer's no different than piss.

180
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,130
No matter how much you drink
you can't get buzzed.

181
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,710
If you're a man, you'll take rum. But...

182
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:30,270
...if you don't have the balls to
take on a challenge from a woman...

183
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,580
I won't force you.

184
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:36,120
But I'll make you wear a skirt,
and a pretty ribbon...

185
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:38,250
...and take you to a dance party.

186
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:44,330
I hate chugging down drinks! However...

187
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:55,870
We're forced to drink at university
parties and company socials.

188
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:58,540
Don't underestimate
Japanese businessmen!

189
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,040
You...

190
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,650
Hey, bartender!

191
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:08,310
Bring all the Bacardi you've got!

192
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:12,490
Well, well... I thought you
didn't like confrontations.

193
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:17,560
Is that so? That can't be good. Go on.

194
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:21,090
I didn't trust Asahi Industries' response.

195
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:27,070
So I left out bait, and a Chinese rat
jumped right in. I'm talking to him now.

196
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:29,670
Who's on the move?

197
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:30,300
One moment.

198
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:33,650
Tell me your owner's
name, loud and clear.

199
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:37,310
Sh-Shingian! Shingian's Wan Taikei!

200
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:43,450
Wan Taikei sent an assassin to get you!
He's sent an assassin to Roanapur!

201
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:44,950
Hear that?

202
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,290
Yeah. Not good.

203
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:48,690
Tell me the number and affiliation
of those soldiers.

204
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,890
Speak loud. Hurry, we're busy.

205
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,460
G-Guys from Extra Order, a
mercenary contracting agency!

206
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:57,160
I don't know how many there are!

207
00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:00,240
The E.O. Company scouts
experienced war junkies.

208
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:01,670
Rotten luck.

209
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:02,670
You said it.

210
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:06,840
Let's get started.

211
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:28,270
Okay, guys. It's party time.

212
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,920
Give anyone trying to
escape extra assholes!

213
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:43,950
Make sure there are only
corpses when we're done.

214
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:56,160
Revy! If they're your
friends, you deal with them!

215
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:57,500
I don't know them.

216
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:01,260
Wow, you've bulletproofed the bar.

217
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:03,400
It can handle up to a. 50 caliber.

218
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:04,280
Revy!

219
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,570
I'm alive.

220
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,110
Benny!

221
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,770
Miraculously, I'm alive.

222
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:09,010
What about Rock?!

223
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:11,140
Dead! People are dead!

224
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,640
I went through all the trouble
of graduating university...

225
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,740
...and got into a good
company! This isn't fair!

226
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:21,090
Don't cry, fool. You've gotta enjoy
life, or you'll let it waste away.

227
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:27,630
Revy! Show them why you're
known as "Two-Hands"!

228
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:34,430
Check the place out. I heard voices.

229
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:38,240
I hate survivors!

230
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:40,740
What a great line.

231
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:01,290
Got 'em, Dutch!

232
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,430
Don't come back here,
Revy! You're a nuisance!

233
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,270
How many times have
you destroyed my bar?!

234
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:10,210
You owe me for all this!

235
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:13,770
Or else I'll weld your asshole shut
and make you a new one in your head!

236
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16,080
Got it. Dutch!

237
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,090
She's...smiling.

238
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,250
Sorry, but at this rate, trading
you is no longer an option.

239
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:36,460
Then what's gonna happen to me?!

240
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:38,090
Well, you weren't really in our plans.

241
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:40,500
How about we just part ways here?

242
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:43,510
That's not fair! I'm gonna die!
Take me with you!

243
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:48,840
Fine then. Just don't drag
us down. Revy! We're leaving!

244
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:50,510
Gotcha!

245
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:02,220
Get in!

246
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:10,400
Take this, you war junkies!

247
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,300
Hey Dutch.

248
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:18,410
Bao was so pissed, he
looked like a steaming pot.

249
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:21,540
He says that unless we pay him
back he's gonna weld our assholes.

250
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,580
Scary. I think I'm gonna cry.

251
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:28,150
What the hell is this? Is this a movie?

252
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:32,590
Don't be stupid. This is a lot
more entertaining than Hollywood.

253
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:39,960
Captain! Sixteen dead, eight
wounded! I'm sorry, sir.

254
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,460
We thought of them as no more than
punks and underestimated them.

255
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:46,230
Storm, they're not just any
group of punks.

256
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:49,240
They're a troop that can stage a
decent killing fest against us.

257
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:53,570
In Liberia, all we had to shoot
at were old men and brats.

258
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,400
Too slow, and no fight left in them.

259
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:03,210
But these guys are full of vigor. I've
been waiting for something like this.

260
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:09,090
If we maintain this speed, we'll
be at the Belawan port by daybreak.

261
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:13,660
We'll meet Balalaika there. So, Rock...

262
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:17,960
Benny is getting in touch with
your company as we speak.

263
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,730
So there is a way to
do stuff like this!

264
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:28,440
If negotiations don't go well, we're gonna
have to leave you in Malaya. Sorry.

265
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:33,050
There are bandits all around there,
but I'm sure you'll be okay for a while.

266
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:34,180
Okay?

267
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,480
What do you mean?!

268
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:36,990
You bring me all this
way just to let me die?!

269
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:41,020
What is this, after dragging
me all over the place?

270
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:43,250
The least you could do is
take me someplace safe!

271
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,420
Don't push your luck.

272
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,530
First you cry, then you wanna
use us as a taxi? All right then.

273
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:55,600
Why don't I show you what
color your brain is?!

274
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:56,170
No...

275
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:01,410
We're connected. We're using an
Assault Dial so the line's secure.

276
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:04,270
Rock, it's your boss, Mr. Kageyama.

277
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:09,350
Department chief! Okajima
speaking. I'm very sorry.

278
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,880
Now, regarding the loss of the disk...

279
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:18,020
Right. Don't worry about that
anymore. That disk no longer exists.

280
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:19,860
I don't understand.

281
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:23,630
Given the situation, I'll tell
you, and only you...

282
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,730
...the truth. Don't tell anyone else.

283
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:27,600
It's hard to explain...

284
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:30,900
...but to hedge against a drop in
business, our board of directors...

285
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:34,680
...agreed to help a war-torn country with
the development of nuclear weapons.

286
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:37,750
That disk contained the plans.

287
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,520
It's nothing but trouble for management.

288
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:45,520
Nukes in this day and age... It
makes me doubt their judgment.

289
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,860
Eventually I'll be...

290
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,350
...at the top and then I can do
something about this.

291
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:51,820
But in the meantime, this
cannot be made public, Okajima.

292
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:55,430
For the sake of the 50,000
employees of Asahi Industries...

293
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:58,100
...I want you to disappear
into the South China Sea.

294
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,700
You'll be promoted two ranks, to
assistant manager.

295
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:02,260
We won't treat you badly.

296
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:05,640
I'll also ask for the president and
everyone under him...

297
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:07,200
...to attend your funeral.

298
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:12,070
The professional ruffians
should be there shortly.

299
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,050
Is it loaded?

300
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:15,720
Fully equipped, Captain.

301
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:17,350
Whatever you fire, whether it's
rockets or the machine guns...

302
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:19,650
...all the more to add to the invoice.

303
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,120
The Japanese are
such generous spenders.

304
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:22,520
Okay, let's go!

305
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:38,240
They sure ditched you easily.
Though I do sympathize.

306
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:41,850
There goes the ransom and bonus.

307
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,810
But is it really enough to make
you throw up?

308
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,140
Leave me alone.

309
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:47,580
Revy. Are you on the deck?

310
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:48,250
Yeah.

311
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:51,190
There's something coming
straight at us over the ocean...

312
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,250
...but it's not a boat. It's too fast.

313
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:56,190
It's way too fast. At 3 hours 5
minutes. Can you see anything?

314
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:04,660
It's a low-altitude assault gun-ship!

315
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:08,200
Damn it! An assault helicopter?!

316
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,570
We have visual!

317
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:13,870
I don't need to see them. I can
smell them. I know it's them.

318
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,350
Damn them. They're gonna
use that thing to kill me.

319
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,550
Rock! Grab onto this!

320
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:22,680
A gun?! Don't make me hold this!

321
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:25,610
Though it won't be more
than a comfort to you.

322
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,350
He's coming. He's on our ass.

323
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:30,780
This isn't good! In fact, this is really bad!

324
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:32,820
He's firing at us!

325
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:38,930
I know it isn't good, Dutch!

326
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:42,040
Hit it! Shoot it down!

327
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:45,200
Shut up! You try it, dumb-ass Rock!

328
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:48,280
I hope you realize that you're
hiding under a torpedo launcher!

329
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:51,080
Make sure you don't get blown up!

330
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:55,040
Rock, you bastard!

331
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,320
I've had it with you guys!
I'm getting outta here!

332
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:01,190
You impotent son of a
bitch! You running away?!

333
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:04,750
Stop it! Why should I suffer like this?!

334
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:11,830
All right. Let's just sit back
and observe from up here.

335
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:15,210
But Captain, right now, we have an
opportunity to turn them into mincemeat.

336
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:18,530
You don't get it, do you?

337
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:21,940
They're in my trap, from
their heads to their tails.

338
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:27,220
Don't you wanna laugh at them while
they cry, howl, and piss themselves?

339
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:33,280
Damn it! How dare you do
whatever you want with me!

340
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:35,920
