1
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:22,260
I have a big gun

2
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:23,840
I took it from my lord

3
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,240
Sick with justice

4
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,360
I just wanna feel you

5
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,040
I'm your angel

6
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,530
Only a ring away

7
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:32,390
You make me violate you

8
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:33,840
No matter who you are

9
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,540
It's all up to you

10
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:43,850
No one lives forever

11
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:45,940
Been burn in the hell

12
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:47,190
By all those pigs out there

13
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:49,310
It's always been hell

14
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:51,000
From when I was born

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,700
They make me violate them

16
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,110
No matter who they are

17
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,400
Get down on your knees

18
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,330
Get a good head on your shoulders

19
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:05,800
If it's for your guys

20
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,710
Go to the end of the earth

21
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,160
Do what you think

22
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,070
Give it with dedication

23
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:14,380
I'll put out your misery

24
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:29,390
Weapon . . . I have it all

25
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:34,820
I see now.

26
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,500
But we can't lend out Rock.

27
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,290
We are off the case.

28
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:40,050
But... why?

29
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,500
Your chief is going to take on Uncle Sam,
an ally of every nation, with her bare hands.

30
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,730
You have to admit that's insane.

31
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:50,140
Precisely.

32
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:53,870
She is trying to face off against the United States itself.

33
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,400
Then that's all the more reason...

34
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,050
She is my family!

35
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,290
I am the only one in this world who can save her.

36
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:07,890
That is exactly why...

37
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:11,930
What an annoying brat.

38
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:15,280
Did you fly half way around
the world just to cry like that?

39
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,030
Then it's your chance! Cry a whole bucket.

40
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:21,030
Who knows? A comic book hero
might come and save you.

41
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:23,290
Why, you...

42
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:24,650
Fabiola, it's all right.

43
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:28,400
You are absolutely correct.

44
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,760
I cannot ask any more of you.

45
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:33,810
We will continue the search on our own.

46
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:36,020
You...

47
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:38,100
have really changed.

48
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:41,010
You have become a full-fledged man.

49
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:47,260
The only people I could depend upon, my father and Roberta, are now gone.

50
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:49,850
That is the only reason.

51
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:51,950
I see.

52
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:54,790
Is that all you have to say, Rock?

53
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:59,920
Abandoning these two kids in a town like this would make even me feel uneasy.

54
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,510
If at all possible,

55
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:06,770
I'd rather they left the rest to us and
returned to their mansion in Venezuela.

56
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:07,740
Then...

57
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:10,040
That's not like you, Mr. Chang.

58
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,650
There's not an ounce of truth to what you just said.

59
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:17,000
Was it too corny for you, Dutch?

60
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,510
The maid will confront the US Army sooner or later.

61
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:24,000
That wouldn't do any good for the town, nor for me.

62
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,340
That's none of our concern.
Keeping the order here is your job.

63
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,430
Cut it, Dutch.

64
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:33,150
Here's a man who's familiar with this town, got many business connections,

65
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:38,280
and harmful to no one, holding a neutral position that won't complicate the situation.

66
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:42,900
Wouldn't you say their pick was spot on, Rock?

67
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:47,050
Why don't you help out those kids?

68
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:53,990
This town, as a whole, hopes

69
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:57,500
that the maid leaves before things get complicated.

70
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:00,270
Everything will resolve itself

71
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:03,870
if I take them and catch up with the maid before she clashes with the US Army.

72
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,890
Is that your request, Mr. Chang?

73
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,740
It's a simple game plan, isn't it?

74
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:15,660
Please give me a little time. I'd like to think it through properly.

75
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:22,030
Listen. If you can't get his assistance, leave this town as soon as possible.

76
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:24,720
Listen to what us adults tell you.

77
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,950
Rock.

78
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:32,410
At this rate, that kid's hair will turn white before he's 20.

79
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:34,410
Give it a good thought.

80
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:42,460
Give it a good thought.

81
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:48,730
See you then, Young Master.

82
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,270
"It's just like looking for a missing cat."

83
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:57,530
"I can squeeze it into my workday."

84
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:00,210
Did you think I'd let you off with a line like that, Rock?

85
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:03,900
The problem comes after you stick
your nose into it looking for the cat.

86
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:08,400
As soon as you open the closet, this cat will bite your torso clean off.

87
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,010
Let me tell you one thing.

88
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:13,490
And no arguing, 'coz I'm the boss.

89
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:18,080
Listen. If the maid and the US Army clash before you get there,

90
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,350
you get out of there right away, at all costs!

91
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:26,490
Another simple game plan, is it?

92
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:29,260
Will he take it up?

93
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:31,140
That's the way he works.

94
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:34,380
He's a rare type of person in this town.

95
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,140
He's so easily moved.

96
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:47,520
A number of syndicates dwell here in Roanapur:

97
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:49,630
The Hong Kong Triads,

98
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:51,590
Hotel Moscow,

99
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:53,460
La Cosa Nostra,

100
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:55,670
The Colombian Cartel,

101
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,750
and numerous others.

102
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:06,510
Once a port used during the Second World War to help accommodate the Japanese navy,

103
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:10,710
Roanapur has since transformed into one great port of drug smugglers,

104
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:15,360
and to this day remains a labyrinth.

105
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:20,270
And you're telling me to help those kids out of this?

106
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,250
Let's think. Think my anxiety away.

107
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,320
Believe in myself.

108
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,520
Where can I intervene?

109
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,130
There's the fountainhead of drugs...

110
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:34,300
and here's the mouth, this very town.

111
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:38,670
Damn it!

112
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:42,850
How far do I have to go 'til you're satisfied?

113
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:45,130
No, let's first...

114
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,600
eliminate.

115
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,170
This matter does not involve the Italians.

116
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:56,890
But this situation was partly triggered by the South American Cartel.

117
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,370
Gustavo said they have forces coming from home.

118
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:05,810
The FARC will conduct the pursuit of the maid firsthand.

119
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:10,650
Then ensues a three-way struggle among the maid, the US Army, and the FARC.

120
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:11,950
And the street fighting...

121
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:14,260
Real military forces?

122
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:21,670
I have a question.

123
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:24,670
Is it about your retirement savings?

124
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:26,030
You're persistent.

125
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:27,090
Well, yeah.

126
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:31,920
Balalaika once said she was indebted to you big time.

127
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,270
What does that mean?

128
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,630
You're going off on a strange tangent.

129
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:38,950
It could be relevant to the matter at hand.

130
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:43,700
So where should I begin?

131
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,930
From the very beginning.

132
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:47,220
It'll take a while.

133
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:58,780
Yep, got it, Dutch.

134
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,390
That's what she meant.

135
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:03,690
Bye. And with that...

136
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,750
another piece of the puzzle is put in place.

137
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:09,120
There are quite a few left.

138
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:13,970
Are these really all the syndicates here in Roanapur?

139
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,150
And that makes a Full House.

140
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:20,400
I win all $230!

141
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,740
Damn you.

142
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:24,960
"God loves a cheerful giver."

143
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,530
You're usually out of good cards when you keep raising it like mad.

144
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:33,450
So what's up between you and Rock this time, Two Hand?

145
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:34,980
You always follow him like a d—

146
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,340
It's way too dangerous.

147
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:39,930
The problem is the people that maid's after.

148
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,470
What did they do?

149
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:45,440
They blew her master all the way up to the moon.

150
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,840
Are they terrorist bombers?

151
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,470
It's Uncle Sam and his merry soldiers.

152
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,820
The United States...

153
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:54,690
Army?

154
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:55,990
Yeah.

155
00:08:55,990 --> 00:09:01,480
Boiling hot with rage, the maid's going to make meat patties out of those soldiers.

156
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:06,400
So why are those soldiers coming over to this shithouse place?

157
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,260
No idea.

158
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:12,240
In the first place, there's no way I could follow his every whim.

159
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:22,240
I thought through everything I possibly could.

160
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,710
This time, I'll definitely...

161
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:26,740
Hello.

162
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:29,730
Oh, it's you. What's the matter?

163
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:35,840
Fabiola! Have you seen Mr. Rock?

164
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:39,810
That makes it the fourth time you've asked about him since sunrise.

165
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,510
I see. You are right.

166
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:46,120
Let me take another walk around the town.

167
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,780
I may pick up some clues.

168
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,140
Hey.

169
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:54,230
Sorry we're late.

170
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:58,780
What's the matter?

171
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:00,840
Was it that unexpected?

172
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,010
Well,

173
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:05,780
I should not be saying this,
but I thought you would not come.

174
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:12,290
It's always fun to solve puzzles, you see.

175
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:19,090
It's just as I told you over the phone.

176
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:22,510
The maid came here and left. I have no idea where she is.

177
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:25,990
Well, so, how did this happen?

178
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:27,480
It's not just me.

179
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,630
The brothel upstairs is also closed because of that kid over there.

180
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:34,000
So I'm just cooling off with the girls like this.

181
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:36,280
Is this really your doing?

182
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,360
No, that is...

183
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,690
I asked you to settle things peacefully.

184
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:42,160
I am terribly sorry.

185
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,110
Bao.

186
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,920
Did you provide for the maid?

187
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:46,880
No.

188
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:51,940
I'm not obliged to tell you all that, you know.

189
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,540
Please, Bao.

190
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:56,370
Well...

191
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,240
Fine then.

192
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,400
But I have one condition.

193
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:03,270
If things go wrong, vouch that
I wasn't involved in any of this.

194
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:04,250
Sure thing.

195
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:07,310
Promise me in writing later too.
It's a matter of life and death.

196
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:09,180
So what happened last night?

197
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,870
Yes, last night...

198
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,860
What did you just say?

199
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:22,950
"Please direct me to a store with every item necessary for a war."

200
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:28,980
Hell no. You've got to be jok—

201
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,960
Does this seem like a drunkard's joke?

202
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:41,070
While I was calling everywhere to connect her, she was chewing on antidepressant pills

203
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:43,960
as if she were stuffing herself
with popcorn at a movie theater.

204
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:49,800
So you directed her to Praiyachat, Torch, and backstreet doctor Doc Hartland.

205
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,120
The doctor's for her to get the pills, right?

206
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,240
She never told me the petty details, nor do I want to know.

207
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:59,000
Thanks for everything. I'll return this favor sometime.

208
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:04,020
By the way, you're not with Two Hands today.

209
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,950
Did you guys have a fight or something?

210
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:07,830
No, it's just...

211
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:26,250
Señor Rock!

212
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:28,050
Y-Yes? What is it?

213
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:35,260
We spent the entire day walking around just to have every place you mentioned practically refuse us at the door.

214
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:37,150
You owe me an explanation.

215
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:38,980
Well, that's...

216
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:41,480
That is not what we talked about at all!

217
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:44,810
Don't get too angry. Of course it isn't.

218
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:47,600
Your chief is a celebrity here.

219
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,900
A girl dressed up just like the infamous maid,

220
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:53,640
and a boy that looks more high-class than anyone this town has seen before.

221
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:58,000
You can't expect anyone to answer us when we're walking around with the two of you.

222
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:01,000
In any case, we need to get things moving.

223
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,600
I will investigate by myself tomorrow.

224
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,170
Fabiola, unfortunately...

225
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,380
We cannot do it by ourselves.

226
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:09,360
However...

227
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,320
You...

228
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:14,510
don't seem intimidated by this town at all.

229
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:21,000
I was raised in a similar place full of idiots and trash.

230
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,620
So it's familiar, to a degree.

231
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,710
She is from the barrios of Caracas.

232
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:27,720
The barrios?

233
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,290
That's what it's known as.

234
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:32,720
It is a slum where people do not even have an address.

235
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:38,440
You can see the area shine like the Milky Way at night in Caracas.

236
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:42,180
The reason these poor slum houses are so bright is...

237
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:45,030
because everyone steals their electricity from the electric company.

238
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,710
That's very resilient.

239
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:50,930
You put it too nicely.

240
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:53,510
But you are my family now.

241
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:56,980
Well, there are eleven people in my real family,

242
00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:00,230
and my parents will be less burdened with me apprenticing here.

243
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:03,520
Then did you train your gun and leg skills there, too?

244
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:04,910
Leg skills?

245
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:09,140
Watch your words.

246
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:11,920
What do you mean by leg skills?

247
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,110
It is capoeira, Young Master.

248
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:16,370
That is...

249
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:22,990
There were guys in the neighborhood in training, so I learned it by imitating them.

250
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:26,820
I know capoeira. It's a great combat sport!

251
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,550
Show me sometime, Fabiola!

252
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:32,130
I-If you do not mind a self-taught style, sometime.

253
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:38,980
As I previously stated, my hometown was not a decent place, so I had to learn self defense.

254
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:44,130
A careless gunshot can kill people, but I have control over this.

255
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:47,660
So I thought it would be a skill worth training.

256
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:51,720
Well said. I think so, too.

257
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:58,390
I largely approve of that mindset, but whether it would work here is a different story.

258
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:01,230
Though I'm not used to giving people advice,

259
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:07,700
you do have to aim at the enemy's weakest point and pull the trigger without hesitation when necessary.

260
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:10,550
But that is a bad temptation.

261
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:13,140
Even Roberta could not resist it.

262
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:15,540
I do not want Fabiola to tread the same path.

263
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:21,590
Well then, you two will be staying at
Mr. Chang's yacht house from now on.

264
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:24,200
It's a hideout with security guards and a pool.

265
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,390
We'll be off after we drive you there.

266
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:27,760
Y-Yeah.

267
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,000
We'll be waiting in the car, so finish your dishes first.

268
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:37,630
I never knew you could say such things.

269
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:40,950
Well, I wouldn't want to see the kids die.

270
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:45,460
But this is about all I can do for them.

271
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:52,240
Just how tough must a person be to cope with the deaths around him?

272
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,420
That's why I don't get too involved.

273
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,280
Rock, can you endure it?

274
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:04,110
I see, I see.

275
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:07,870
NSA and CIA are fighting over their territory.

276
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:15,490
We, the CIA, are bound to know of any mission that has been approved by the AIC.

277
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:21,120
Depending on their moves, we may have to utilize the intelligence network.

278
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,750
The trigger of this situation,

279
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:29,910
Venezuelan political activity intervention plan 114,

280
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:34,030
has also been planned and carried out without our involvement.

281
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:38,300
They most likely intend to broaden their control over espionage missions,

282
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:42,240
taking advantage of the CIA's shift to a focus on economic information warfare.

283
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,730
This is incredibly displeasing.

284
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:46,140
Maintaining a big family...

285
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:49,280
sure gets difficult.

286
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:56,090
Well, all right. Let us keep close track of any Americans lurking in the town then.

287
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:58,430
You are a valuable client after all.

288
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:03,700
We appreciate it. My boss should get back to you regarding payment and other details.

289
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:11,800
For starters, people should be gathering for a conference at Golden Swinging Nightclub,

290
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,150
one hosted by the Triads.

291
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:22,220
I don't know about the Young Master, but the maid was really excited about Mr. Chang's yacht house.

292
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,040
Yeah.

293
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:25,500
Why are you so down?

294
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,930
It's the Mafia.

295
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:32,010
Where are they headed to?

296
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:37,540
To a liaison group to discuss
the case we're also involved in.

297
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:40,010
Oh, I see.

298
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:44,830
Reality is moving closer to my predictions from last night.

299
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:49,220
So this evening's meeting will determine her future, huh?

300
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:51,630
No, it won't be determined just yet.

301
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:52,920
Not yet?

302
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:56,970
There's not that much time left for both ourselves and the Young Master.

303
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:01,300
Remember what Dutch said?
Watch out for critical turning points.

304
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:04,570
The turning point is still ahead of us.

305
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:08,330
The turning point at the clash lies even further in the future.

306
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:25,830
Hey, Balalaika. Is today your birthday? It's quite a party.

307
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:30,720
Are we here today just for your bad Italian jokes?

308
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,110
I'll just leave then.

309
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:32,870
What?

310
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:37,770
Calm down, Tomazzo. She's a country bumpkin who doesn't know how to socialize.

311
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:42,280
Hey, Amigo, sorry to cut your playtime short, but we'd like to get things rolling here.

312
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:45,050
Precisely.

313
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:52,640
By now, Chang should be telling everyone about the maid and the enemy she's after.

314
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,200
But those who don't understand how serious the situation is

315
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,130
will make fun of it.

316
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:03,780
Got it. The solution is extremely simple, Mister.

317
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:06,830
Host a party for them to make up.

318
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:11,590
Pop open some champagne, get a huge cake and bring in some dancer girls with big boobs.

319
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:15,600
Since when did Sicily get into the comedy business?

320
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,080
Shut up, you sloppy Ivan!

321
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:20,660
Let's go on.

322
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:26,770
Behind the terrorist bombing that killed the maid's master, there are military personnel on active service.

323
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:29,680
Chang talks about the identity of Roberta's enemy.

324
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:33,660
That is sure to grab Balalaika's attention,

325
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:38,980
for the Russian Mafia under her were once part of the Soviet Air Forces,

326
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:44,570
soldiers trained to match the US Army in the Third World War.

327
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:49,630
But the Colombian Cartel will react completely differently.

328
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:56,080
To keep our relations with the FARC intact, we need to bring them the maid's head pickled in salt.

329
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,130
We will be hunting that maid down!

330
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:06,570
It's unexpected, but you seem to have some guts.
However, our enemy is not the maid but rather her enemy.

331
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:11,380
The Yankees' goal is simple: an anti-drug campaign.

332
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:16,440
We must strike before they have their way with this town.

333
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:21,770
Thirty-five years have passed since this decaying port became the metropolis of vice.

334
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:23,750
The only reason why this outlaw Roanapur

335
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:29,160
never appeared in the headlines of the New York
evening news, nor became the talk of the town was...

336
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:36,040
because we, the rulers of this town, shared the same vision.

337
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:39,310
But this town is frail and feeble at best.

338
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:42,690
If we were to allow outsiders to intervene even once,

339
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:46,480
who will remain standing in the ring at the end?

340
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,350
Nobody will be there, ladies and gentlemen.

341
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:53,580
Neither you nor I, not even the ring itself.

342
00:20:54,680 --> 00:21:01,380
However, even if they recognize the impending crisis, they won't be able to locate Roberta immediately.

343
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:05,240
Where is she?

344
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:08,020
I only have so much information to guide me.

345
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:11,530
Yet I can't even follow up with it. Damn it!

346
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:14,100
El Señor conoce mis debilidades.
The Lord seest my weaknesses.

347
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:17,280
Porgue nada es posible, sin la gracia de Dios,
For naught is possible without the grace of God,

348
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,980
te pido Señor que los consignes como consideres necesario.
let Your countenance abound those who answer unto You.

349
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,960
Permite a este discipulo evitar los pecados enviados,
Commit not sin upon thy fellow disciple,

350
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,690
y llevar a cabo, con rectitud, de los designios de tus palabras...
but proclaim His virtues throughout the world.

351
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:28,750
Y dotame de fuerza para que pueda acoger y sobreponerme...
Heavenly Father, bestow upon us the strength to endure...

352
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:30,230
You'd be better off not taking that drug.

353
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:31,920
A los retos que me impones por tu divina gracia.
the mortal challenges imposed on us, with Your divine grace.

354
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,950
You are already overdosing.

355
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:42,600
Are you not going to return to that orchid-blooming estate?

356
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:46,370
There's a kid awaiting your return there.

357
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:54,390
Is what you're pursuing really revenge? Or are you...

358
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:59,590
Both Master and Young Master deserved heavenly blessing.

359
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:03,640
I alone will take responsibility for my sin! Yet...

360
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:10,410
You cannot compensate for your past no matter how much you repent...

361
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:13,550
even if you were to drive yourself to ruin.

362
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:14,430
Shut up!

363
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:20,980
Shut up!

364
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,570
Shut up! Shut up!

365
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:28,040
Whoa, wait, don't shoot! It's me, Leroy!

366
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:33,490
What's up with you? All I did was get clothes as you ordered, but you—

367
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:34,530
What about the wanted poster?

368
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:39,080
Everything's taken care of.
Now it's just a matter of money.

369
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,830
Who in the world...

370
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:45,080
were you talking with just now?

371
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,950
So what do you want me to do?

372
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:53,570
We are pressured for time. I'd like to catch up with the maid immediately.

373
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:59,170
Rock, you're not trying to make amends for being unable to save that schoolgirl's

374
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:02,010
yakuza boss dad back in your country, are you?

375
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:03,600
No...

376
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:09,640
Then, when you stuck up to Sis to save her,

377
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:13,910
something inside you must have emerged from the depths of desperation.

378
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:15,010
Am I wrong?

379
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:18,000
A hobby you say?

380
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,490
Yes, it's my hobby, just like yours.

381
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,530
As you said, it's your dangerous personal hobby.

382
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:31,620
How do I justify keeping up with that? Tell me.

383
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:38,390
You always support me in my moments of gravest danger. I do thank you for that.

384
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:40,900
Thank me, eh?

385
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:46,270
What do you think?

386
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:50,900
See, I need to perform a ritual before joining the gamble.

387
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:55,030
Under what pretext should I follow you and your nonsense?

388
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:57,560
I'm...

389
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:00,420
I'm done with just waiting and seeing.

390
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:06,250
When we were in my country, you said you were a gun.

391
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:09,070
If you are the gun, I am the bullet.

392
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:13,600
But I'm nothing more than
a piece of lead right now.

393
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:18,260
Had I never come to this town, I would have died as a mere piece of lead.

394
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:20,710
But I did come.

395
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:24,210
The gunpowder is sitting there waiting to explode.

396
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:26,180
The only thing that can light it...

397
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:28,690
is the gun.

398
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:34,150
"Light My Fire", is it?

399
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:37,880
Don't you know? It's a number by The Doors.

400
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:40,580
Rock, what kind of a bullet are you?

401
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,670
A Full Metal Jacket?

402
00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:43,890
A Hollow Point?

403
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:46,910
Or a Glaser Safety Slug?

404
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:51,750
No. You are the unpredictable silver bullet.

405
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:54,730
It has enough power to obliterate an invincible monster.

406
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:56,730
It's a pricey but invincible bullet.

407
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:58,920
Yet...

408
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:04,170
it's over if you miss the timing. The monster will devour you.

409
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:11,350
I'm out of water.

410
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:14,800
Rock, there's a vending machine downstairs. Get some for me.

411
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:20,560
Hey, use baht. It'll break if you use nickels.

412
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,540
Got it.

413
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:30,910
Really, no fair.

414
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:40,190
Oh, Revy. I'll bring the water right up.

415
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:43,430
Old man Praiyachat should be around at this time of day.

416
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,270
We have to return to the ship by evening.

417
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:50,620
Let's get it over with, Rock.

418
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:02,590
Young Master?

419
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:05,720
Are you asleep?

420
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:07,420
Good.

421
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:20,080
Someone's having a good time.

422
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:23,470
You happy, kid?

423
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:26,160
There are pools in Venezuela, too.

424
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,970
It is only that I've personally never swum in a pool.

425
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:31,930
S-So I just... For a little...

426
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:34,910
Still, you didn't have to sneak out to swim.

427
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:36,650
My sincerest apologies.

428
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:38,970
Hey, Young Master.

429
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:44,420
How can she ask you for time off when you're
desperately looking for that goddamn glasses bitch?

430
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:47,280
She's that devoted to you.

431
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:52,380
You carry a whole family upon your shoulders, and you still can't see that?

432
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:55,400
Do not talk so rudely to Young Master!

433
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,630
Stop it!

434
00:26:58,530 --> 00:27:02,380
We are going to visit the same places today.

435
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:01,100
Stop it!

436
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,220
Is the old man here? This is Rebecca from the Lagoon Company.

437
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:12,820
Oh, it's you, Revy. How're your Cutlasses doing?

438
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:17,560
They're doing great. But that's not what I came here for today.

439
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:20,300
Hmph, another one of these...

440
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:24,020
So do you want me to choose one for her, then?

441
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:26,440
That means she was here...

442
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:29,650
a woman like this one, only taller and with glasses, right?

443
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:31,760
Bao referred her to here,

444
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,800
so I gave her an offer though I never saw her before.

445
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,440
What did she ask for? Was it a gun?

446
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,020
No, actually,

447
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:42,180
she already had her own gun.

448
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:47,690
It was a rather antique flintlock rifle of 18th century Spain.

449
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:49,660
Young Master.

450
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:51,720
I know, Fabiola.

451
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:54,940
That's the gun that used to be displayed in our banquet hall.

452
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:59,550
She asked me to refurbish it so she could use it.

453
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:02,560
It was in an okay condition so it was no problem.

454
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:06,730
She still needs gunpowder like cordite or black powder though.

455
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:08,080
Is that why she asked for Blaster Torch?

456
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:09,820
Wait, Revy.

457
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:11,790
Your grip is crooked.

458
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:14,720
The butt of a gun is for knocking brains out, no?

459
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,840
Idiot, this is a one-of-a-kind!

460
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:21,840
Torch! Hey, Blaster Torch!

461
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:26,410
Y-You! I thought I blocked your death wave with the aluminum foil,

462
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:28,920
and now you're here to do it yourself!

463
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:32,400
Fine then. I'll take you on! Fucker!

464
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,470
What is this?

465
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:35,910
Just play along with him.

466
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:37,770
Hey, hey, calm down.

467
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:41,940
She might be a space alien, but she's a good alien!

468
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:43,230
I don't trust you!

469
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:02,730
You are as punctual as always, Mr. Chang.

470
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:05,640
It's one of my virtues. Let's get down to business.

471
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,010
Oh, so it wasn't a woman?

472
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:13,730
It was the guy who works as a broker, a tip-off, or something.

473
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:15,510
Who was it again?

474
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:19,500
Don't do drugs in the middle of a conversation, idiot!

475
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,200
Who was the tip-off?

476
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,890
Oh, damn it! I can't remember.

477
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:28,350
It should jump out at me after a shot of heroin. Can I, Revy?

478
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:29,400
Stop fucking around!

479
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:37,700
The unit who infiltrated the town, formed to carry out advanced political selections under the NSA,

480
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:43,110
is the 9th operation unit of Pentagon's
Special Operations Command, SOCOM,

481
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:47,940
and although listed as the 56th Engineer
Construction Battalion in the command hierarchy,

482
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:52,230
at the JCS, it is known as...

483
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:54,810
"The Gray Fox Command Group."

484
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:59,180
So it's the foxes being chased by the bloodhound maid.

485
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:08,170
Their main mission is to capture General Shue Yan, the most powerful warlord under Khun Sa in the Golden Triangle

486
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:11,810
and call him to the Supreme Court of the United States.

487
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:16,460
It should bring about utter grief to the Triads,

488
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:22,850
for the Triads' heroin purification facility will be useless without the General's opium fields.

489
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:23,850
When is the date?

490
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:27,530
Late this month; the assault team consists of eighteen men.

491
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:33,530
They disguised their way in as backpackers traveling together, and are currently on standby at the motels here.

492
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:34,550
Their locations:

493
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:36,890
Squad Alpha is at Tokaina Hotel;

494
00:30:36,890 --> 00:30:39,530
Squad Bravo is at Blue Moon Motel;

495
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:41,830
Squad Charlie is at Lansup Inn.

496
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:45,180
Major Caxton, the commander, is with Squad Alpha.

497
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:47,790
That's enough, Agent.

498
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:49,740
We are not done.

499
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:52,460
Tell me your countermeasure.

500
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:57,290
I don't think there's that much trust between us.

501
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,550
You're just sucking up to the government at best.

502
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:03,370
Don't think you can boss us around.

503
00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:11,880
You are terribly mistaken. Let me give you a piece of advice.

504
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:14,900
We do not suck up to the government.

505
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:20,150
Think of the United States as a gigantic hydra with countless heads.

506
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:25,350
You may have the power to bring
individuals and companies to their knees,

507
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:30,560
but we have enough power to annihilate entire countries.

508
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:36,490
Indeed, we are the single strongest being in the entire world.

509
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:39,120
And so...

510
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,140
don't you look down on my company...

511
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:43,240
punk.

512
00:31:44,850 --> 00:31:46,610
Let me see.

513
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:48,610
Roy, Roy...

514
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:49,450
Lero...

515
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:50,650
Wait, that's right!

516
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:52,200
It's Richie Leroy!

517
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:56,430
Richie Leroy is directly involved with the maid!

518
00:31:56,430 --> 00:31:58,640
That's the puzzle's final missing piece!

519
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,410
Let's go!

520
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:07,710
NEXT EPISODE

521
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:14,130
Young Master is waiting in the garden for me to return with the heads of the conniving foxes.

522
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:19,220
Young Master will greet me with a smile, and everything will be back to normal.
