1
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,830
It should be daybreak there soon.

2
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:52,840
The sea at daybreak.

3
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:59,470
Appreciating that is something a worthless student would do.

4
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:06,270
But it is a disgusting winter sky.

5
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:09,600
Right now, Okajima-kun is in the Sea of Heaven.

6
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,270
Would you prepare two plane tickets?

7
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:14,190
Yes sir.

8
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:16,110
A business trip, sir?

9
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:20,610
Let us go there as well, to the Sea of Heaven.

10
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:55,270
Why do I need to suffer like this?!

11
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:06,370
Rock, you bastard!

12
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:08,660
How much do you think a gun costs?!

13
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:11,170
They came here to kill me.

14
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:17,000
Why is the Department Chief causing me to go through this?

15
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:21,800
You have something mixed up.

16
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:25,180
They want to destroy that data disk, right?

17
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,560
Your life is just-

18
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,810
My life is just an accessory to that. Damn it!

19
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:30,850
Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!

20
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:33,270
You know, there's a torpedo in there.

21
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:33,980
Shut up!

22
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:35,310
Shut up!

23
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:39,690
Doesn't this seem weird to you, Benny?

24
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:41,490
Yeah, something's weird, Dutch.

25
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:44,370
They're not shooting at all now.

26
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:46,990
They should be able to make us into swiss cheese.

27
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:50,500
I agree. Something's strange.

28
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,880
Dutch! What's going on?

29
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,170
Where'd they go?

30
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:56,960
Benny-Boy.

31
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:01,880
They're 5,000 meters behind us and they're keeping that distance.

32
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,310
What are they after?

33
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,310
Something...

34
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,690
Damn it.

35
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,150
The water way!

36
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:20,070
Yeah, the water way.

37
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:24,700
The path from here to Balawan is filled with rocks and mangroves.

38
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:28,030
If we keep going it's just going to get tighter.

39
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:30,450
In the end we won't even be able to take evasive maneuvers.

40
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:33,370
Let's bolt.

41
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:33,830
Yeah.

42
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:06,610
Don't say that I suck at this.

43
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:09,870
I guess it doesn't matter now.

44
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,620
I won't say it.

45
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:15,080
I had no choice but to evade to the right.

46
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,420
I know.

47
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:23,300
We drove into the mouth of a river?

48
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,630
Isn't this a river?

49
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:28,340
Won't we run out of places to run if we keep going?

50
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:30,510
We know that.

51
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:35,140
We've been completely trapped.

52
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,650
The enemy got behind us again.

53
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:41,570
He's looking down on us from 5,000 meters back.

54
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:46,950
Look at that: A sunken ship. Fucking inauspicious.

55
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:53,040
This is fine.

56
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:54,750
We'll stay here.

57
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,250
Go on, go on.

58
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:00,040
Show me your asses and go on.

59
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:04,760
But, you guys will come back to me.

60
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,470
And then you'll have to face me.

61
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:10,340
Hurry up and come back!

62
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,550
Let's end this.

63
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:16,980
Dutch, they've stopped by the sunken ship.

64
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,270
They're not chasing us.

65
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,440
So there's no point in even giving chase.

66
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,820
That's what it means.

67
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:25,780
Damn it.

68
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,890
A dead end.

69
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:52,850
Seems like it.

70
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:53,720
Damn it!

71
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,350
Hey, Mayer.

72
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:58,230
Yes?

73
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:04,230
Don't you get excited when you wonder how they'll react in this crisis?

74
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:06,610
They don't have a chance.

75
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,990
They'll become a beehive before our superior weaponry.

76
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:15,200
That's why I can't wait to see how they'll react.

77
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:21,460
If they're boring and won't even try, then we'll just torture them to death.

78
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:25,090
There's no road ahead of us.

79
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:27,960
We'll have to turn around and go back.

80
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,920
But he'll be waiting for us.

81
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:36,510
My gut tells me they set this ring.

82
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:39,220
They want to finish this face to face.

83
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,190
So, who's going to ring the gong?

84
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:48,900
Sometimes you'll find them around.

85
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,860
Ancient bastards who think they're gunmen.

86
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,410
Wait a sec!

87
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:56,120
So the only choice left is to die?!

88
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:59,410
Well calm down, calm down, Rock.

89
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:02,620
Let's call the police. That's better than dy-

90
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:09,000
You're helpless. Calm down.

91
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,170
Nothing's gonna get solved if you panic.

92
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:14,510
If you want to survive use your head, your head!

93
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,430
Dutch, how about waiting for them to run out of fuel?

94
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:22,890
The bastards are from E.O. They'll come to finish us before that happens.

95
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:23,310
Damn it.

96
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,770
Why did it end up like this?

97
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:31,940
Not this one.

98
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,950
I'd like a business paper.

99
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:36,280
I want to check on my stocks.

100
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,410
Understood, Kageyama-sama.

101
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:45,960
How's the damage to the ship?

102
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,880
Nothing much so far.

103
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,960
I'm just worried about that.

104
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:55,880
If even one round hits the torpedo we'll fly to the moon.

105
00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:00,100
It's your own fault for keeping it on the ship, you dumbass.

106
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,560
I thought, I might have been able to use it for something.

107
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:06,730
It's a waste, but let's just throw it overboard.

108
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,360
I guess we don't have a choice.

109
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,520
What a waste.

110
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,030
Wait.

111
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:13,280
Dutch, listen to me.

112
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:14,650
Just stay asleep.

113
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:18,160
I understand something, now that I've thought about it.

114
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:18,780
Hear me out.

115
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:24,290
If you bother my thought process, I'm gonna let Revy nail you again.

116
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:27,960
Then let's have a shoot out, face to face.

117
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,080
Are you an idiot?

118
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:32,210
Shoot out?!

119
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:35,300
At most we have an anti-tank rifle.

120
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,180
They have rockets!

121
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:41,470
It looked like that chopper had heat-seeking homing missiles.

122
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,230
Damn it. We're not even close.

123
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:46,600
You think so?

124
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,190
We've got something.

125
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:50,690
Revy, what did you give him to drink?

126
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:52,070
It wasn't me.

127
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:55,240
It's a head-on game of chicken right?

128
00:09:55,530 --> 00:10:02,740
This ship's speed and armaments, that sunken ship, they're all here.

129
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:06,000
What...

130
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:09,420
...are you thinking?

131
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:13,050
What you guys were just talking about.

132
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:18,180
Let's fly them to the moon.

133
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,390
Impossible.

134
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:26,230
There's no way we can do it.

135
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:31,110
By all accounts this ship is made to accelerate quickly.

136
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:34,230
At full speed we're only this much into the water.

137
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:37,490
Dutch, we don't have anything else.

138
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:38,490
I'm in.

139
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:43,660
The plan won't work unless they're right in front of us.

140
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:46,000
Do you have any guarantees, Rock?

141
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:51,000
They're having a blast chasing us around.

142
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:54,130
Despite having a complete advantage.

143
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:58,010
What reason would they have to restart the whole fight?

144
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:01,390
You said it yourself.

145
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:06,020
He's the type to imagine himself as a gunman.

146
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,020
If we start a chicken race, he'll face us.

147
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:15,940
I don't have any guarantees. From this point on, it's up to you as Captain.

148
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:22,530
We sure picked up one crazy son of a bitch.

149
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:24,780
You've got to be insane.

150
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:29,410
But this is exciting,

151
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:32,460
and being exciting is an important thing, Rock.

152
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:34,000
Let's do it!

153
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:36,130
The radar, Captain!

154
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:37,500
They've started moving.

155
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:41,430
Let's take their challenge.

156
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:46,970
Rock!

157
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:49,310
Do you know what you're doing?!

158
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:53,150
If they fire a rocket, fire the signal flare away from the ship.

159
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:54,520
Correct!

160
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,690
I see our dumbass.

161
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:57,940
Revy!

162
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:59,490
It's a chicken race! Make them play!

163
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:05,410
They're shooting!

164
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:06,740
Of course they are!

165
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,370
Exciting! I accept!

166
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,000
Rock! It's coming!

167
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:13,830
Use the flare gun!

168
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:22,170
We did it.

169
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:24,430
We're on the alpine course.

170
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:25,680
Both of you get in the cabin.

171
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:32,020
They plan on using the sunken ship as a shield. Useless.

172
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:32,730
Mayer.

173
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:33,190
Sir!

174
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:35,520
When we cross paths we'll get them in one shot.

175
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,900
We're going to end this duel.

176
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,650
I'm gonna fuck you baby!

177
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:42,400
300 feet left.

178
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:44,610
150.

179
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,120
100!

180
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:55,620
Fire #1! Fire #2!

181
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:19,060
I fucked you!

182
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:44,760
My head's not torn off.

183
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:47,090
My sunglasses aren't broken.

184
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,050
Amen, hallelujah, peanut butter.

185
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:53,970
Lordy lord fucking Christ.

186
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:55,560
I'm never doing this again.

187
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:57,650
Benny? You ok?

188
00:13:57,650 --> 00:13:59,650
I'm alive somehow.

189
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:01,070
But the instruments are messed up.

190
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,570
We need to fix them up. We're-

191
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:06,240
Hey! How about Rock?

192
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,570
He's out cold over there.

193
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:11,620
Right before we hit, he howled.

194
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:15,500
Like a line by William Holden out of "The Wild Bunch".

195
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:19,880
And he looks so comfortable sprawled out like that.

196
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:22,090
No kidding.

197
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:32,470
When that moment passed, the excitement from the adrenaline faded away.

198
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,690
My boiling blood had gone back to normal.

199
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:41,730
Where am I?

200
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:44,610
And what am I doing here?

201
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,650
Good job.

202
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:53,700
Smart business is lovely, Dutch.

203
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:58,660
But, you look terrible.

204
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:01,960
It's like we're going to a Soho social.

205
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,670
Leave us alone.

206
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:05,340
Then, Mr. Kageyama.

207
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:08,590
We at Hotel Moscow have a code of honor.

208
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:13,800
Oh? I thought you were the Burgenbiria Trade Company?

209
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,140
We followed through in our own way.

210
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:21,440
There shouldn't be any grudges.

211
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:28,400
The world is full of things that can't be helped.

212
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:33,490
Now, it's your turn to follow through in your own way.

213
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:35,950
We'll cover the details at the hotel.

214
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:37,450
Understood.

215
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,830
Good job, Okajima-kun.

216
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:43,130
Now, let's go.

217
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,130
Okajima-kun? What are you doing? Come on.

218
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,670
Department Chief, don't you remember?

219
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:00,060
I'm already dead.

220
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,440
You told me so.

221
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,150
My name is...

222
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:05,400
My name is Rock.

223
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:10,360
I see. As you wish.

224
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,950
Let's go, Fujiwara-kun.

225
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:13,990
Yes sir.

226
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:25,670
Rock?

227
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,630
I apologize for making you stay with those idiots.

228
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:34,640
But, it'd be a waste to keep such a tough guy as a Japonski.

229
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:38,810
Come to us, if you ever need help.

230
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,430
Take care.

231
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:45,810
Okajima-kun...

232
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:49,610
He is no longer an employee.

233
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:52,030
A manager should no longer care.

234
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:56,030
But, why so suddenly?

235
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:58,660
It doesn't matter.

236
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,410
So, Rock...

237
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,040
What will you do now?

238
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:07,250
I'm not a hostage anymore.

239
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:09,000
I've got nowhere to go.

240
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:17,050
I know a place that could use a sailor.

241
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:19,260
Are you interested?

242
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:21,520
They're a delivery company...

243
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,730
...and brush against the law from time to time.

244
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:25,770
Right?

245
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:48,670
What's wrong?

246
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:51,550
There's a boat that's blocking our way.

247
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:54,300
We're blowing our horn but it's not moving.

248
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:01,600
What is it?

249
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:15,530
Well, it couldn't be helped, to let that little bit leak.

250
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:18,200
We were prepared for that much.

251
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,870
Job well done, Kageyama-kun.

252
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:22,330
Thank you very much.

253
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,170
Testing, testing.

254
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:39,010
Good morning everyone aboard the St. Joan.

255
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:44,010
Why don't you wear the aloha shirt I got for you at the market?

256
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:45,600
Because, we're on the job.

257
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:51,060
This has become my job now.

258
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:58,700
Everyone of the St. Joan, I apologize for the sudden request but...

259
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,820
...please stop your ship.

260
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:07,910
My personal opinion is that-

261
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:16,260
Complying with the request as quickly as possible, would be the best course of action!

262
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:20,050
Dutch, the St. Joan have opened up their communications.

263
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:22,050
We made contact.

264
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:23,260
And, what did they say?

265
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:27,770
Unless we get out of their way, they will force their way through.

266
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,730
It can't be helped.

267
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:30,600
Ok, Benny.

268
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,020
Revy?

269
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:34,020
I couldn't wait.

270
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:36,230
The time for being a gentlemen is over.

271
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,990
Everyone, please take cover!

272
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,530
These moments make my prehistoric blood awaken.

273
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:49,660
What was that?

274
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:51,750
They have a rocket launcher!

275
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:52,580
Give it here!

276
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:53,670
Stop it!

277
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:56,340
Listen up limp-dicks!

278
00:19:56,340 --> 00:20:00,010
My rockets are faster than electric signals!

279
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:05,720
If you don't want to end up as a blood filled ghost ship, then stop, you shit-heads!

280
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:17,520
Benny-Boy, report to the Lun-i Pan that we've taken the St. Joan,

281
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:21,990
and that they need to come get it before anyone starts a ruckus.

282
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:22,700
Roger.

283
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,490
I'm home.

284
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:30,700
Ohh, John. Good boy.

285
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:38,500
Takanori, how's it going,

286
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:41,340
with your studies for college acceptance?

287
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,260
Not very well.

288
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:46,100
Are you home today?

289
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:51,390
About your daughter, she's been coming home late.

290
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:55,770
She's only 18. Will you say something to her?

291
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:57,900
Isn't that your job?

292
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,030
Stocks.

293
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:04,030
Daddy?

294
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:10,200
What color was the sea, when you went to the south on your business trip?

295
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,250
Color of the sea?

296
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:13,000
I don't know.

297
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:16,380
Daddy was busy with work.

298
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,090
No one may believe me, but...

299
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:25,380
...I became a pirate in the South Seas.

300
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:29,100
That huge ship was today's prey.

301
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,890
Let's get back to port before lunch.

302
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:34,390
The China bowl at Tao Han...

303
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:38,020
...sells out fast.

304
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:23,130
We're being targeted by pirates?!

305
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:25,300
What's the background on our client?
